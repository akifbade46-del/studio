# LocalPOD - Delivery Management System (Static Version)

This is a lightweight, modular web application for managing Proof of Delivery (POD) records. It's designed to be hosted on standard web hosting like Hostinger. It uses the browser's **localStorage** to simulate a database, meaning all data is stored locally on the user's device.

## Core Architecture

*   **Frontend**: A modular, multi-file structure using plain HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript (ES Modules). The UI is clean, mobile-first, and does not rely on any heavy frameworks.
*   **Backend Simulation**: All data (users, PODs, etc.) is managed through JavaScript and stored in the browser's `localStorage`. There is no server-side backend or database connection required for this version.
*   **Firebase Integration (Read-Only)**: The app is designed to fetch job details from a Firebase database (read-only) to reduce manual data entry.

## How to Deploy on Hostinger

Deployment is extremely simple because this is a static application.

1.  **Upload Frontend Files**:
    *   Connect to your Hostinger file manager or use an FTP client.
    *   Navigate to your main public directory (usually `public_html`).
    *   Upload `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` into this directory.

2.  **Test**:
    *   Open your website's URL. The LocalPOD login screen should appear, and the application will be live. All data you create will be saved in your browser.

That's it! No database setup or server configuration is needed for this version.
